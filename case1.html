      <h3>description</h3>
      <p>North America is moving towards Veganism or Vegetarianism due to the known environmental impacts of red meat. By shifting to a more vegetable-based diet, one person can save approximately 219,000 gallons of water a year. In addition to consuming colossal amounts of water annually, the meat industry contributes to  the emission of greenhouse gases, deforestation, water pollution, and waste of food resources — all of which hasten the effects of global warming. Our project intends to emphasize the environmental impact of producing 1lb of beef by outlining its production process from farm to table. </p>

      <h3>process + research</h3>
      <p>Our first iteration was to present the environmental impact of red meat. However, the topic is way too broad and we did not want to create an website with overwhelming information. After a few iterations, we narrowed down the environmental impact of Alberta-grown, Vancouver-sold beef, and landed on the topic of “Your Beef from Fram to Table”.</p>

      <h3>information architecture + wireframe</h3>
      <p>As a team, we decided to create an one page horizontal scroll website. This way, the users would be able to go see and access the process of “Beef from Farm to Table” while scrolling through the site.</p>

      <h3>art direction</h3>
      <p>The concept of the web design was to emulate the bold yet organic look of beef packaging. Punchy colours are placed against backgrounds that resemble paper packaging to create a fresh aesthetic.</p>
